Support

Verification service providers
- In order to detect and/or prevent fraud and comply with our legal obligations, we will sometimes need to share your information with third party identity verification services. This lets us make sure you are who you say you are, by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases.

Your legal rights
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data:
‍
Request access
This enables you to receive a copy of whether your personal data is being processed or collected, what and how personal data about you is being processed and collected, and what the data processing operations are. This is also commonly known as a “data subject access request”.
Request correction
This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
If you need to add or change any information, you can just log into your Circle account and make the change in your settings. If it doesn’t look like you can make the change on your own, please reach out to
Support
and we’ll take care of it.
Request deletion
This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with applicable law.
Please note: your right of deletion would not take precedence for various reasons including if we need to retain your personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish or defend a legal claim. Where we are unable to comply with your request of deletion, we will notify you at the time of your request.
Object to processing
You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.
In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
You may also be entitled to object to automated decision-making in certain circumstances.
Request restriction on processing
This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to delete it;
(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
Request for data portability
If you ask us, we will provide to you or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
Withdrawal of consent
This applies where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request
.
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
Time limit to respond
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month or in accordance with applicable law. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
California Customers
The following Section applies to California customers only and supplements the information contained in the Privacy Policy.
Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)
In addition to the rights provided in the Privacy Policy above, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information, subject to limited exceptions. In this Section, we will refer to both the CCPA and CPRA collectively as the “CPRA.” Under the CPRA, “personal information” includes information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. Circle collects personal information that may be covered by other laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its related implementing regulations, and, therefore, such personal information may be exempt from the provisions of the CPRA. Although some categories of data collected by Circle may be exempt from the CPRA, the full list of categories of personal information collected can be found in Section 2 (the Data We Collect About You).
When we talk about the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information, we are also using those terms as they are defined in the CPRA.
This section describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
‍
Right to Know
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. You have the right to request that we disclose to you:
(a) the categories of personal information we’ve collected about you, (b) the categories of the sources from which the personal information is collected, (c) the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing the personal information, (d) the categories of third parties to whom we’ve disclosed personal information, and (e) the categories of personal information we’ve disclosed for a business purpose, sold, or shared and the third parties to whom we’ve disclosed, sold, or shared that personal information.
Right to portability (request a copy of your personal information)
You have the right to request and receive the specific pieces of personal information we’ve collected about you in a commonly used, machine readable format.
Right to correct
You have the right to correct inaccurate personal information that we have collected from you and retained.
Right to delete
You have the right to request that we delete any of the personal information that we’ve collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Right to opt-out of sale and sharing
You may request to opt out of any “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information that may take place.
Right against discrimination
You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of your CPRA rights.
‍
Do not sell or share personal information
Circle discloses personal information to third parties for its targeted advertising and data analytics purposes. These disclosures may be considered “selling” and/or “sharing” of personal information. Please note that Circle is not a data broker and does not disclose personal information in exchange for money.
The California Privacy regulations require us to state whether we have actual knowledge that we have sold or shared the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. As stated in our
User Agreement
, the Circle Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 18. We do not sell or share personal information of consumers we actually know are under 16 years of age.
Exercising your rights
To exercise any of your California privacy rights described above, please submit a request
here
.
Only you, or your authorized agent acting on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information.
Your request must:
Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include: your full name, prior communications with Circle.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request. If we are unable to verify your identity from information we have available, we may request additional information from you to verify your identity. If you use an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, we may require proof from you that they have been authorized directly by you to act on your behalf. We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it and for security or fraud prevention purposes.
We will respond to your rights request as required under the CPRA. We are only obligated to respond to a request from you, or your authorized agent acting on your behalf, twice within a 12-month period.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Please note that the above rights are not absolute, and we may be entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, where exceptions under applicable law apply.

Digital assets are subject to a number of risks, including price volatility. Transacting in digital assets could result in significant losses and may not be suitable for some consumers. Digital asset markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available with other forms of financial products and are subject to an evolving regulatory environment. Digital assets do not typically have legal tender status and are not covered by deposit protection insurance. The past performance of a digital asset is not a guide to future performance, nor is it a reliable indicator of future results or performance. Additional disclosures can be found on the
