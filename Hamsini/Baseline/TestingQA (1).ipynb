        "BitPay collects personal data during key operational moments across their service platforms and jurisdictions. Data collection occurs during initial account registration, throughout active transaction processing, during customer support interactions, and in real-time platform usage sessions. Collection takes place across their web platform, mobile applications, merchant integration points, and verification partner networks, with specific protocols for each location. The system employs technical tools to gather data through automated collection at these touchpoints, implementing specific measures for data minimization and jurisdictional compliance. Each collection timing and location is documented in their data mapping system, with clear records of processing purposes, retention periods, and legal bases.\n",

        "Organizations conducting research with sensitive data must implement specific safeguards while balancing scientific needs. As outlined in Recital 156, while research enjoys certain exemptions, it requires appropriate safeguards for data subject rights.
