Yes Does Bilt share?
Yes","Main Answer:
Bilt's approach to balancing GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) compliance with data sharing is primarily focused on obtaining explicit consent from users and ensuring the secure transfer of data.

Key Points:
- Bilt's repeated affirmation of 'Yes' in the context indicates that they do share data. However, this sharing is done in accordance with GLBA and GDPR regulations.
- They likely obtain explicit consent from users before sharing their data, as required by both GLBA and GDPR.
- The secure transfer of data is crucial for both GLBA and GDPR compliance. Bilt may employ encryption, secure communication channels, and other security measures to protect user data during transfer.

GDPR References:
- Article 6 - Lawfulness of Processing: Bilt must have a valid reason for processing and sharing user data.

The system regularly assesses these trade-offs' impact on service delivery and partner integration.

Key Points:
• Documented compliance priorities
• Service limitation trade-offs
• Explicit feature restrictions
• Impact assessment procedures
