Main Answer:
Organizations must carefully navigate data subject rights when dealing with legacy systems to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations. The key principle is to balance the rights of the data subject with the rights of others, while also considering the technical challenges of legacy systems.

Key Points:
• Organizations must respect data subject rights to access their personal data, even in legacy systems, without compromising the rights of others.
• A thorough review process is necessary to identify and protect sensitive information, such as trade secrets, intellectual property, and software copyright.
• When providing access to personal data, organizations should ensure it does not imply the erasure of data that the data subject has provided.
• The right to receive personal data should be balanced with the rights of other data subjects and the technical constraints of legacy systems.

Main Answer:
Organizations should establish clear and legitimate data retention periods at the time of personal data collection, ensuring that the duration is explicitly stated and limited to what is necessary for the specified purposes. This is a critical aspect of GDPR compliance.

Key Points:
• Data retention periods should be defined based on the specific needs and purposes of the data processing activities. For example, if personal data is collected for a one-time event, the retention period should be short-lived.
• The principle of data minimization should be applied, meaning that personal data should be stored for the shortest time possible while still achieving the intended purpose.
• Organizations must consider the legal requirements and obligations that may impact data retention. This includes sector-specific regulations and data protection laws.
• Regular reviews of data retention policies are essential to ensure ongoing compliance and to adapt to changing business needs or legal requirements.

Organizations must establish retention periods based on the specific purposes for which data is processed. As emphasized in Recital 39, time limits should be established for erasure or periodic review. This requires analyzing legal requirements, business needs, and data subject expectations. Organizations must document their retention decision rationale and implement technical measures to ensure automated deletion or review when retention periods expire.

Key Points:
• Purpose-specific retention period determination
• Regular review of retention necessity
• Technical implementation of deletion systems
• Documentation of retention period rationale
