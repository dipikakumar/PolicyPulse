Klarna customers have several GDPR rights regarding credit decisions made by Klarna based on the context provided. These rights include:

Key Points:
- **Right to Object to Automated Decision-Making**: Since Klarna uses automated decision-making for fraud assessment, customers have the right to object to this process (Article 22 GDPR). However, they can only do so if they are subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or significantly affects them.
- **Right to Access**: Customers have the right to access their personal data that Klarna processes for credit decisions. They can request a copy of this data, as well as information about how it is being used, who it is being shared with, and how long it will be kept (Article 15 GDPR).
- **Right to Rectification**: If the personal data that Klarna processes for credit decisions is inaccurate or incomplete, customers have the right to request rectification (Article 16 GDPR).
- **Right to Erasure**: Customers can request that Klarna erases their personal data if it is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, if they withdraw consent, or if they object to the processing (Article 17 GDPR). However, this right does not apply if the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

Additionally, if the shopping service processes sensitive personal data, such as data related to health or criminal convictions, Klarna customers have the right to explicit consent for this processing under Article 9(2)(a) UK GDPR. They can also request that Klarna restricts processing of their data if they contest its accuracy, if the processing is unlawful, or if the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected but is required for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims (Article 18 GDPR).
